Part 1: Elements.

The information in the page is contained inside the tag called "body". Inside the body, we have the structure of the page. So there, we can see the "table" tag, which separates the information like a table. Inside the body of the table, we have the "tr" tag, defined as "table row". Each "tr" contains different information described in the "td", "table data" tag. 

There is a tag called the "a" tag. This tag is used to link the page in which we currently are with another page. We also have the "span" tag that is used to group up in-line elements.

The "div" tag is used to define a division inside the HTML document. It is used as a container of elements so that all elements inside de div have the same style.

The "script" tag is used to reference an executable code that is outside of the HTML file.


Part 2: Sources.

The "index" file contains the structure of the webpage. It's the HTML file.

The "hn.js...." file is a JavaScript. The JavaScript contains the necessary functions that are used so that all the elements of the webpage work.

The "news.css...." file contains the style of the webpage. The color, size and type of letter used, position of the different elements, etc.

There are 3 ".gif" files, which are images used inside the page.


Part 3: Network.
